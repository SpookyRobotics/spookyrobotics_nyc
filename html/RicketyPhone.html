          <h2>RicketyPhone</h2>
          <h3>Repurposing ancient technology </h3>
          <p>
            As a smartphone user who values being on the cutting edge, I have consistently
            replaced my phone every two years. This has lead to a pile of devices that
            have sat in my drawer for years. I knew that one day I would want to use these
            miniature computers for side projects. RicketyPhone is a collection of libraries
            that allow an older Android phone to be used as a display and interface to a
            single board computer.

          </p>
          <h3>Bill of Materials</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Android phone running Api 9+</li>
            <li>Raspberry Pi Zero</li>
            <li>Micro USB to USB Type A adapter</li>
            <li>Micro USB cord</li>
            <li>Power Supply for Raspberry Pi</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Methodology</h3>
          <p>
            The phones have various sized screens with varying damage to them. The solution must be able to
            disable parts of the screen for output. Will need to build a way for a connected
            computer to communicate with the phone for drawing. The phone will need to run an
            application that defines its working area, and display visual input as best as possible.
            We will be using the <a href="https://github.com/jsjrobotics/GraphPaper">GraphPaper Experiment</a> to draw a bitstream of information outputted by the
            Raspberry Pi.
          </p>
          <p>
            My oldest phone is API 9. After researching api capabilities, I read I will have to
            communicate over USB with the phone. The phone i have doesn't have the accessory
            support library, so I will use the ADB running on raspbian to communicate with the
            phone. Any application on the Pi will need to use ADB commands to communicate with
            the phone. The application will send an intent with any relevant data. The phone will
            run an application that listens for these intents, and displays the relevant data.
          </p>
          <p>
            To limit the drawing area, will write an Android application that has a custom layout
            per phone. An attached device will be able to request a graphic be drawn in a section
            of the screen. There is a limit between how much data can be sent from an intent to an
            app, so we must be sure to stay within those limits.
          </p>
          <h3>Use Cases</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Sensor connected to Raspberry Pi. Sensor sends value to Pi. Pi wants to display value
            on Phone. Pi sends intent over ADB and phone displays value. Raspberry Pi now has
            a visual display.</li>

            <li>Raspberry Pi wants to read a value from Phone. Pi sends intent to Phone signaling
            requested information. Phone can a) send intent with response or b) write response to
            local storage for reading by Pi over ADB. Raspberry Pi now has all sensors on phone.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Task List</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Create Android project with GraphView</li>
            <li>Connect phone to Raspberry Pi</li>
            <li>Program Raspberry Pi to send intents over ADB</li>
            <li>Program Android project to respond to intents</li>
          </ol>
